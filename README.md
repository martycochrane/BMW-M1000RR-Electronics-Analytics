## Objective

To be able to visualise what's happening with the bike on track and where to adapt the parameters in the kit electronics to give the desired effect.

Below you can see two examples taken from turn 5 at Redbull Ring. The idea is to visualise the target slip (surface plot) and the actual slip (green line). If the rider feels the bike is sliding too much or two little then it's very easy to see where the adjustments should be made to optimise the rider feeling
